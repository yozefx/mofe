<b>About MOFE</b>
<p>
I developed MOFE to be an alt to using KOF91 and MUGEN. Both engines rock in my opinion but as far as i know none of them have the ability to play
online. Besides I also wanted to try my hand at making a fighting game engine just to see how challenging it was. 
Right now the Current Engine isnt entirely Complete. There are still a few bugs and unfinished moves. At anyrate I wanted to play a fighting game online with my friends where we could create or download our own choice of fighters and battle each other. 
<br><br><p>
Well i got pretty far in MOFE, i got partway into the networking and just realised i want some better IDE power. So i moved
all my code from blitzplus to Blitzmax, its more like C++ than blitzplus is and i got alot more GFX functionality using it.
I want to eventually compete with MUGEN, im pretty sure i rank up there with KOF91 that is until i finish the online play. 
Right now the Engine can import KOF91 ini fighter files. however there are a few extra fields that my editor uses that KOF91 does not.
